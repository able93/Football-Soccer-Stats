# Football-Soccer-Stats
This WebApp stores some soccer/football stats, including the World Cup, Premier League and Champions League, with simple visualization that allows for easy understanding and interpretation. 

Information includes the winners of the World Cup, Premier League and Champions League and the years they won. It also shows the FIFA ranking of countries, and a t-test analysis is done to know if the World Cup performance of a country strongly influences their FIFA ranking compared to their performances in continental tournaments and international friendlies.
